# Verder Helpen

[Verder Helpen](https://verderhelpen.nl) offers a solution that enables people to securely identify themselves during live chat, video calls and even phone calls. This solution is used by governmental organisations to be able to remotely assist citizens with questions that would otherwise require a visit to the town hall.


## Components

The solution consists of several components, all of which can be found in [verder-helpen](https://github.com/verder-helpen/verder-helpen), the most used being:
- `core`
- `auth-digid`
- `comm-common`

Together, these components enable the full functionality of Verder Helpen. Comm-common can be integrated into any communications platform, and is already being used by WeSeeDo, T:meblockr, Livecom, Messagebird (previously 24sessions) and more. DigiD is the Dutch standard for citizens to login with government. Other authentication options offered are:
- `auth-yivi`

The components `auth-test` and `comm-test` are placeholder components, used to test the solution without live systems.
